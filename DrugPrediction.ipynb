    "   • Ferrous Gluconate (Fergon): Another option with potentially fewer gastrointestinal side effects.\n",
    "   • Ferrous Fumarate (Feosol): Provides a higher amount of elemental iron compared to other forms.\n",
    "2. Intravenous Iron\n",
    "   • For patients who cannot tolerate oral iron or need rapid replenishment:\n",
    "     - Iron Sucrose (Venofer)\n",
    "     - Ferric Carboxymaltose (Injectafer)\n",
    "     - Iron Dextran (Dexferrum): Usually administered in a hospital or clinic setting.\n",
    "3. Vitamin C Supplements\n",
    "   • Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C): Helps improve the absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract. It’s often recommended to take with iron supplements.\n",
    "4. Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs)\n",
