    "   • For anemia management, often in conjunction with ESAs:\n",
    "     - Ferrous Sulfate (various brands)\n",
    "     - Ferrous Gluconate (Fergon)\n",
    "7. Dietary Adjustments\n",
    "   • Low Protein Diet: Reduces the workload on the kidneys.\n",
    "   • Low Sodium Diet: Helps control blood pressure and reduce fluid retention.\n",
    "   • Reduced Phosphorus Intake: To manage phosphate levels.\n",
    "   • Consultation: The patient should consult a nephrologist for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized treatment plan. The choice of medication and management strategy will depend on the specific underlying cause of the kidney impairment and the overall clinical picture.\"\"\",\n",
    "    1: \"\"\"For a patient with low hemoglobin (HGB) and ferritin (Ferr), indicating possible anemia with iron deficiency, here are common treatments and medications:\n",

    "   • Ferrous Sulfate (various brands): A common first-line treatment for iron deficiency anemia. Dosage often ranges from 100 to 200 mg of elemental iron per day.\n",
    "   • Ferrous Gluconate (Fergon): Another option with potentially fewer gastrointestinal side effects.\n",
    "   • Ferrous Fumarate (Feosol): Provides a higher amount of elemental iron compared to other forms.\n",
    "2. Intravenous Iron\n",
    "   • For patients who cannot tolerate oral iron or need rapid replenishment:\n",
    "     - Iron Sucrose (Venofer)\n",
    "     - Ferric Carboxymaltose (Injectafer)\n",
    "     - Iron Dextran (Dexferrum): Usually administered in a hospital or clinic setting.\n",
    "3. Vitamin C Supplements\n",
    "   • Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C): Helps improve the absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract. It’s often recommended to take with iron supplements.\n",
    "4. Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs)\n",
    "   • If anemia is severe or due to chronic kidney disease:\n",
    "     - Epoetin alfa (Epogen, Procrit)\n",
    "     - Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp)\n",
    "5. Diet Adjustments\n",

    "     - Poultry: Chicken, turkey.\n",
    "     - Fish: Salmon, tuna.\n",
    "     - Leafy Greens: Spinach, kale.\n",
    "     - Legumes: Lentils, beans.\n",
    "6. Additional Considerations\n",
    "   • Diagnose Underlying Causes: It’s essential to identify the underlying cause of anemia, such as chronic disease, bleeding, or malabsorption issues.\n",
    "   • Regular Monitoring: Monitor hemoglobin and ferritin levels to assess response to treatment and adjust as needed.\n",

    "2. Sulfonylureas\n",
    "   • Glyburide (Diabeta, Micronase)\n",
    "   • Glipizide (Glucotrol)\n",

    "3. Thiazolidinediones\n",
    "   • Pioglitazone (Actos)\n",
    "   • Rosiglitazone (Avandia): These improve insulin sensitivity in muscle and fat tissue.\n",
    "4. DPP-4 Inhibitors\n",
    "   • Sitagliptin (Januvia)\n",
    "   • Linagliptin (Tradjenta): These help increase insulin release and decrease glucose production.\n",
    "5. GLP-1 Receptor Agonists\n",
    "   • Exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon)\n",
    "   • Liraglutide (Victoza): These help increase insulin secretion, decrease appetite, and slow gastric emptying.\n",
    "6. SGLT2 Inhibitors\n",
    "   • Canagliflozin (Invokana)\n",
